## Adding Bootstrap 4

npm install --save bootstrap@next

We need to add @next to the package name because at the time of writing this post Bootstrap 4 is still in beta. The @next addition makes sure that version 4 of Bootstrap is installed, not version 3.

The NPM command installs Bootstrap 4 into the folder node_modules/bootstrap and at the same time makes sure that the dependency is added into the package.json file.

Change styles in .angular-cli.json by
        "styles": [
            "styles.css",
            "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"
        ],
